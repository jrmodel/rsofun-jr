\title{Creates a log-likelihood cost function for biomee with different targets}
\usage{
create_cost_likelihood_biomee(targets)
}
\arguments{
\item{targets}{A character vector indicating the target variables for which the
optimization will be done. This should be a subset of \code{c("GPP", "LAI",
"Density", "Biomass")}.}
}
\value{
A cost function which computes the log-likelihood of the simulated 
targets by the biomee model versus the observed targets. This cost function has 
as arguments a vector of calibratable model parameters \code{par}, a data frame of
observations \code{obs}, and a data frame of driver data \code{drivers}.
}
\description{
Creates a cost function for parameter calibration, which
computes the log-likelihood for the biomee model fitting several target 
variables for a given set of parameters.
}
\details{
The resulting cost function performs a biomee model run for the value of
\code{par} given as argument. \code{par} must always contain \code{'phiRL',
'LAI_light', 'tf_base', 'par_mort'} and the error terms corresponding to the
target variables, e.g. \code{'err_GPP'} if GPP is a target. Make sure that
the order of the error terms in \code{par} coincides with the order of the targets
used to create the cost function.

The likelihood is calculated assuming that the 
predicted targets are independent, normaly distributed and centered on the observations. 
All targets have the same weight in the optimization objective. The optimization 
should be run using \code{BayesianTools}, and the likelihood is maximized.
